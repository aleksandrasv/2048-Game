# 2048-Game
Text-based version of the game of 1024, which is the same idea as the game of 2048.   When the program starts it defaults to a board size of 4.  It is allowed to change the board size for up to 12*12.   The goal for a 4x4 board is to get a tile with the value 1024.  Each additional increment in board size doubles the goal value, so a 5x5 board would have a goal of 2048, a 6x6 board would have a goal of 4096, and so on.
